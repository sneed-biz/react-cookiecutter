# Simple Create React App

This is a simple app built off the Create React App that provides a base for capturing state-protected views. It comes with a simple login (username "user", password "cat123") and logout functionality, as well as a simple text field search and form. These are all features I find myself constantly rebuilding when I have to put a UI over some of my projects.

As a result, this is a simple cookie-cutter version.

## Features

- **Login and Logout:** 
  - Username: `user`
  - Password: `cat123`
- **Protected Views:** State-protected routes that require login to access.
- **Search Functionality:** Simple text field search to filter user data.
- **Add New User Form:** Form to add new users with `name`, `age`, and `position` fields.
- **Export Functionality:** Export search results to CSV or JSON.
